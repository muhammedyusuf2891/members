wow!
I must admit I've never done any task as difficult as Forking a Repository, not even bathing my younger ones. LOL.
I really appreciate the idea that a channel was created on Slack which gave me the opportunity to relate with other members and ask questions.
It was really fun though! I learned so many things I never thought was possible for me to learn. 
I really thank the organisers and Admins that came up with the idea of DSC Benin. I am patiently waiting for the next task, I hope it will be easier. ;)
